# MH Cargo Tracker

## ❓ Description

- It finds the nearest town to that HQ  
- Using the cargo monitor, it calculates how much of the chosen cargo was delivered there  
- The totals are added to each company’s score and shown in a league table  
- If companies appear, go bankrupt, or merge, their entries are updated automatically
